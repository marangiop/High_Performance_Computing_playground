# message-passing-programming-coursework
This is the repository for the Message Passing Programming coursework as part of the MSc in HPC with Data Science. The objective of this piece of work is to implement a two-dimensional lattice-based calculation that employs a two-dimensional domain decomposition and uses
non-blocking communications. The developed code was applied within the context of image reconstruction from a starting image containing edges. This operation is conceptually similar to a large number of real scientific HPC calculations that solve partial differential equations using iterative algorithms such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel.
