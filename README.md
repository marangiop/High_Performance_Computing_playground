# MPP 
The objective of this piece of work is to implement a two-dimensional lattice-based calculation that employs a two-dimensional domain decomposition and uses non-blocking communications. The developed code was applied within the context of image reconstruction from a starting image containing edges. This operation is conceptually similar to a large number of real scientific HPC calculations that solve partial differential equations using iterative algorithms such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel.

# TP
The objective of this piece of work is to implement the affinity scheduling algorithm (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/344281) using the Open Multiprocessing (OpenMP) framework.
